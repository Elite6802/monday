            My dearest love, as you reach the end of this journey through our shared memories,
            know that this websiteâ€”every photo, every quote, every starâ€”is just a mirror reflecting the immense light you bring to my life.
            The greatest gift is not one I can wrap, but the one you gave me three years ago when you chose to be mine.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6">
            Looking back, I see a tapestry woven with late-night laughs, quiet comforts, and the kind of understanding that transcends words.
            You are my constant, my adventure, and the soft landing I always need. Each new year with you is simply the best year of my life,
            and I am endlessly grateful for the privilege of watching you grow, thrive, and shine.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-6 font-semibold text-secondary-gold">
            This birthday marks not just a passing year, but the beautiful promise of all the adventures yet to come.
            May your day overflow with joy, and may you feel the depth of my love in every moment.
            Thank you for being everything I never knew I was looking for. I love you more than words can say.
          </p>

          <p className="text-xl font-dancing mt-8 text-primary-pink">
            All my love, forever and always.
